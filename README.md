## CEGEP Program Level Ongoing Evaluation & Data Mining for Student Success

This repository holds different scripts which work off of the anonymized CLARA data tables. All collaborators on this project should have these tables stored locally on their computers, and then modify the _'file.path.to.data.directory'_ variable at the top of most scripts (there is no data stored in this repository)

Many thanks go to 
 - Derek Gaucher and Anna Likht from Dawson College's Office of IST for composing the scripts which extract the data from college databases
 - the Dawson College Science program, for support and feedback throughout the developpment of initial versions of this project
 - This project was made possible through funding provided by the _Programme de Recherche en Enseignment et Apprentissage_
